# GCN-MHG
This is a implementation of GCN-MHG proposed in our paper:

Caihong Mu, Heyuan Huang, Yi Liu, and Jiashen Luo, Graph Convolutional Neural Network based on the Combination of Multiple Heterogeneous Graphs

# Requirements

torch>=1.4.0

tensorboardX==2.5.0

scikit-learn==1.0.2

# How to start
We provide three datasets (Lastfm, Douban and Flixster), You can start model training by running main.py
