# GCN-MHG
This is a implementation of GCN-MHG proposed in our paper:
Caihong Mu, Heyuan Huang, Yi Liu, and Jiashen Luo, Graph Convolutional Neural Network based on the Combination of Multiple Heterogeneous Graphs

Requirements
torch==1.4.0
pandas==0.24.2
scipy==1.3.0
numpy==1.16.4
tensorboardX==1.8
scikit-learn==0.23.2
tqdm==4.48.2

We provide three datasets (Lastfm, Douban and Flixster), You can start model training by running main.py
